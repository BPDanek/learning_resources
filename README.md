PDF's &amp; Links to lecture slides/papers/topics helpful for learning RL/ML/DL/Scientific Computing in my other repos

### Scientific Computing/Applied Linear Algebra
(too many links. [B. Welfert](https://math.la.asu.edu/~bdw/) has made this semester a tough one.)

### Reinforcement Learning & Classic Learning concepts
Neural Networks for Machine Learning (Lecture 6a @ UToronto), G. Hinton: [cs.tornonto.edu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)

On the importance of initialization and momentum in deep learning (paper), G. Hinton: [cs.tornonto.edu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ehinton/absps/momentum.pdf)

Adversarial Attacks on Neural Network Policies (paper), P. Abbeel: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02284)

Are Deep Policy Gradient Algorithms Truly Policy Gradient Algorithms? (paper), A. Madry: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02553)

Optimal Control (Lecture @ ASU), Y. Ren: [designinformaticslab](http://designinformaticslab.github.io/_teaching/designopt/optimalcontrol.pdf)

Reinforcement Learning (Lecture 14 @ Stanf), FF Li: [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2017/cs231n_2017_lecture14.pdf)

Python/Numpy Tutorial for Computer Vision (Lecture @ Stanf), J. Johnson: [cs231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

 Adversarial Machine Learning Reading List (Researcher Blog), N. Carlini: [nicholas.carlini](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2018/adversarial-machine-learning-reading-list.html)


### Robotics
Fast, Autonomous Flight in GPS-Denied andCluttered Environments, K. Mohta: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02052.pdf)
Includes powerpoint that is my report on this for [jdas](https://web.asu.edu/jdas/home) and pdf
### Additional
[Rocky Duan](http://rockyduan.com/) characterizes the goals/achievements I strive for in terms of industry success 
post-graduate work. I stumbled upon him after looking at OpenAI's toolkits when looking for a way to visualize successful 
learning in my RL problems. 

[Nicholas Carlini](https://nicholas.carlini.com/) Obviously a successful PhD @ berk, but I particularily like their interest
with/in alternative adversarial attacks methods. The audio based attacks made me wonder if we could attack other natural 
sensory equipment. Image for a second that we use ML for taste ID. Could we cook/bake a specific substance that would attack 
the gradient of the taste buds?

[Andrej Karpathy](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/) He's in charge of ML in tesla autopilot... I hope he doesn't know 
about PGD so I can get a [free tesla & internship ](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-reward-bug-bounty-research-program-2019-1)
